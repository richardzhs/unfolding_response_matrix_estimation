# Response Matrix Estimation in Unfolding Elementary Particle Spectra
This repository contains code for estimating response matrices and performing the corresponding unfolding tasks in the context of elementary particle physics.

## Overview
The repository includes the following scripts:

* `simulation.R`: Estimates the response matrix for the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum.

* `Drell-Yan.R`: Estimates the response matrix for Drellâ€“Yan events.

* `demo.ipynb`: Demonstrates the unfolding procedure using the estimated response matrices. This script reproduces the main results presented in the paper.
